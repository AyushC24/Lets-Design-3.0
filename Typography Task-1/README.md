# Typography Task-1 

**OPEN TO ALL**Â **No need to claim this issue**Â **NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER 19th December 11:59 PM**

**The text file is provided in the "Typography Task-1" folder itself.**

This First Task is for you to show off your Typography Skills. Typography helps create harmony and consistency in a design. The main purpose of typography is to make it easier to read what you've written: It makes it possible to quickly scan your text. I[t](http://text.it/) compels readers to interact with your writing. When done correctly, it strengthens the argument it makes.

> ðŸ’¡ This task should be done in **Google Docs**.

## Procedure:

1. Skim through the given text once and define theÂ **Hierarchy**Â i.e., mark Headings/ Sub-headings/ Important points.
2. Decide the Font/ Type-face you would be using according to the context of the text. You can do font-pairing i.e, use different font for Headings/ Sub-headings but, don't loose theÂ **Consistency**.
3. Check for margins and spacings. The proper use of white space ensures an excellent user experience and a great readability experience. It helps to balance design elements and better organise content to improve the visual communication experience.
4. For Submission you would have to provide the link to the doc file in a text file (Named after your github username) and make sure to keep the file inÂ **"Typography Task-1"**Â folder only.

If you are unclear with certain points, you can read this article:Â [https://designmodo.com/letterform/](https://designmodo.com/letterform/)



## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

You must at least define the Hierarchy for the text. Simply copy and pasting the given text without any improvements would not qualify for MDC.
